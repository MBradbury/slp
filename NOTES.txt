This file contains some important notes that it is useful to be aware of.


=Message Size=

The default maximum message size is fixed as a compile-time macro.

TOSSIM will calculate something based on the length of a message, irrespective of
the compile-time maximum size. So if a message size changes size, do not expect
a simulation seed to produce the same results.

=Proactive Attackers=

Currently proactive attackers that schedule the attacker to do something at a
specific time has a bug. The attacker model causes different results when comparing
an attacker who does nothing and an attacker who does nothing and schedules an
event every second. It is expected that these two models should produce the same
result.
