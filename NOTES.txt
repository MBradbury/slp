This file contains some important notes that it is useful to be aware of.


=Message Size=

The default maximum message size is fixed as a compile-time macro.

TOSSIM will calculate something based on the length of a message, irrespective of
the compile-time maximum size. So if a message size changes size, do not expect
a simulation seed to produce the same results.

=Proactive Attackers=

Currently proactive attackers that schedule the attacker to do something at a
specific time has a bug. The attacker model causes different results when comparing
an attacker who does nothing and an attacker who does nothing and schedules an
event every second. It is expected that these two models should produce the same
result.

=PrintfClient=

See http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.os.tinyos.users/41337 for instructions to build the dependencies for PrintfClient.

Expect to make further changes depending on your Java set up

-go to /tools/tinyos/java/env
-compile getenv:
gcc "-I$(JDK)/include/linux" "-I$(JDK)/include" -shared -fpic net_tinyos_util_Env.c -o libgetenv.so
-go to /tools/tinyos/java/serial
-compile toscomm:
gcc -O1 -shared -fPIC "-I$(JDK)/include" "-I$(JDK)/include/linux" NativeSerial_linux.cpp -o libtoscomm.so
(you could probably also use -O2 -s on both of these commands to
reduce to size of the libs, but these are the original commands from
the Makefile)
-copy both .so files where your JRE can see them (e.g. on my computer
it's /opt/java/jre/lib/amd64)

=TinyOS Contrib=
