This file documents the procedure that was used to gather the results for the paper:

"Selecting Source Location Privacy Aware Routing Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks via Decision Theoretic Procedure" by Chen Gu, Matthew Bradbury Jack Kirton and Arshad Jhumka
presented at the Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS), 2018. (Under review)

All algorithms are implemented in the folder: 
[algorithm/adaptive_spr_notify](../../algorithm/adaptive_spr_notify)
[algorithm/phantom](../../algorithm/phantom)
[algorithm/phantom_walkabouts](../../algorithm/phantom_walkabouts)
[algorithm/ilprouting](../../algorithm/ilprouting)
[algorithm/protectionless](../../algorithm/protectionless)
[algorithm/protectionless_ctp](../../algorithm/protectionless_ctp)

1. Set up the repository and its dependencies as specified by [README.md](../../README.md)

2. download the dataset from https://zenodo.org/record/1045454#.WgfgH7boCfQ and unzip it.

3. Place all the six subfolders into results/ in the repository.

4. To generate graphs, run "./create.py phantom_walkabouts graph-dominating-min-max".
